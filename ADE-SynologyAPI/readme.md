# ADE-SynologyAPI C# API Client Assembly Project

This implementation of the Synology API is build on top of the excellent work of Allan Brunskill and his project Synology.Net 
You can find his nuget package at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Synology.NET and the sources at: https://github.com/brunskillage/Synology.NET


This library exposes parts of the following Synology API's:
- ActiveBackup
- CloudSync
- HyperBackup
- Core.Security

This is not a complete implementation.  I only implemented what i needed for my own purposes.
Feel free to send me your additions and comments.

I did not want to change the original Synology.NET sources, so my api classes do not use the original SynologyBaseApi (for the moment)
